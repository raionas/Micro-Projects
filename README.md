## Micro-Projects
Mini projects completed from udemy employing R, Python and ML (Machine Learning)

#### Description: 
Programming In Python For Data Analytics And Data Science. Learn Statistical Analysis, Data Mining And Visualization.
All are compiled thru jupyter notebooks.

#### Files:

##### (1) Financial-Data-Analyis.ipynb

About: Analysed financial figures on an exploratory nature such as which months achieved the highest profit after tax deductions, highest months for expenses and revenues incurred which transalates to good and bad months. 

##### (2) MicroProject-NBA-In-Game-Statistics.ipynb

About: Analysed In-Game Statistics for an NBA dataset such as Free-throws and how they correlate to each Player's shooting accuracy and what does it translates to have a high free-throw accuracy against a large number of free-throw attemps.

#### (3) World-Trends.ipynb

About: Data Analysis and Visualisation using seaborn to derive insights on which countries and income group play a major and minor consumer with Internet consumptio. Also, a comparison on how we expect to live during the 1960s and the present age.
